“How did structured error handling and logging change how you wrote and tested this program?”

Structured error handling and logging changed how I wrote this program because first of all, since I wrote the program with try and catch
right away instead of trying to add them in later, I was able to make a more structured code that made it much easier to implement 
the while loops I like to add always to make the program more user friendly. Logging was also really useful as I could see everything
that happened in my program in an easy to read text file. By using try-catch anytime I could possibly run into an error
I have the catch exceptions ready and waiting to grab the error, handle it gracefully and log it to a file so I can see what
happened and when.
